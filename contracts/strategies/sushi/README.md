# Introducing Sushi HODL Vault and Strategy

Invest along Mark Cuban! The Sushi HODL vault is a Harvest
Finance vault for farmers who like to wait for their Sushi
to properly ripen before eating it. It HODLs your Sushi with
love, care, and a little bit of magic by working with a strategy
developed by a loaf of bread. The strategy ensures that your 
Sushi gets transported into the SushiBar effortlessly by a mighty
Chad who uses a one-of-a-kind Tesla Tractor (stay away, Elon, dibbs 
by #BreadForThePeople!) that minimizes the carbon footprint by
burning virtually no gas. 

In the SushiBar, your Sushi multiplies. The SushiBar is like 
a tiny closet filled with magical fairies that glue themselves
onto your Sushi and in sub-zero temperatures, they slowly transform 
into more rice, dead but fresh fish, and more whatever-ness you 
like on your Sushi. 

To support the fairy-transformation process, 
the mighty Chad takes the Sushi (we can now call it xSushi, because 
it is Sushi with fairies) sprinkles a bit of Aave into that beastly 
Sushi fridge. Placing xSushi into Aave coating expedites the 
multiplication process. The fairies use the Aave powder to wrap 
themselves into cocoons and when they are ready, they come out as tiny
little dead fish freshly cut up into pieces.

The Chad is mighty, but not almighty. He was selected through
a careful interview process looking for a Chad with an allergy that ensures
that if Chad ever eats Sushi, licks the Aave powder, or just smells
a fairy's leg, he will drop dead on the spot. Therefore, Chad can 
only pamper your Sushi, load it on the Tesla Tractor (dibbs!) and take
it on a ride back and forth whenever you want it, but he will never 
eat your Sushi, xSushi, or the xSushi with Aave coating. He will also
never share it with other farmers. All the extra rice, dead but fresh fish,
and the whatever-ness that you like on your Sushi and that was made for
you by the cocooning fairies will be yours to devour. Or HODL. You should definitely 
HODL. That's what Mark said.
